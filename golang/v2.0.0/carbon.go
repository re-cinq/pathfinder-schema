	// The time boundary of a PCF refers to the time period for which the PCF value is considered to be representative
	// While PCFs should be calculated on a regular basis to track improvements over time, the resources

	// PCFs shall therefore have a maximum validity period of up to three years, provided that no major

	// In such scenarios, emission factors from secondary sources should be used (base case).
	//
	// The employment of secondary emission factors shall be compliant with the general quality rules

	// while still allowing for flexibility in the data sources used, the Pathfinder Framework defines a series
	// of safeguards that secondary emission factors shall comply with if they are to be used for the
	// calculation of PCFs:
	//
	// 1. Documentation:
	//    - Data included in the secondary emission factor shall be validated in line with globally recognized LCA principles.
	//    - The emission factor source should ensure transparency by providing information on key methodological (i.e., LCA modeling approach,
	//      aggregation and allocation approach, if any) and data
	//      (time period, geography, technology,representativeness) elements
	// 2. Management and maintenance:
	//    - If life cycle inventory databases are used, they shall be periodically maintained and updated
	//      with the latest data sets.
	//
	// 3. Choice of modeling:
	//    - The modeling of the secondary emission factor shall be consistent with the methodological principles of this Framework
	//      (e.g., attributional approach).

	// The share of primary data in percent. See the Pathfinder Framework Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, Appendix B.
	//
	// Initially, companies shall calculate and report, as part of PCF data exchange, on at least one of the following metrics:
	// - Primary Data Share (PDS): Percentage of PCF emissions that were calculated using primary activity and emissions data
	// - Data Quality Ratings (DQRs): Quantitative score for five data quality indicators based on the data quality matrix
	//
	// From 2025, both metrics shall be reported by companies to ensure continued alignment with
	// the Pathfinder Framework. This will ensure a fuller picture of both the quality of the PCFs and the
	// amount of primary data being used to calculate them. Until 2025, companies should base their
	// initial choice of metric(s) on the relevance to their situation and resources available. For instance, a
	// company calculating a PCF for the first time may not have access to a large amount of primary data and
	// may wish instead to reflect on the accuracy of the secondary sources used to calculate its PCF.
	//
	// Primary data share calculation:
	// To create visibility on the share of primary data in PCF calculations, the PDS in each data set should
	// be determined and exchanged across the value chain. This can be done by calculating the proportion
	// (percentage) of the total GHG emissions (CO 2 e) that is derived using primary data:
	//
	// Formula: Part of PCF based on primary data (CO2e) / PCF (CO2e) = PDS PCF (%)
	//
	// In order for an input to be considered primary data, both the activity and emission factor shall be
	// compliant with the primary data definitions included in Table 5 (see a clarifying example below, Table 8).
	//
	// In order for the upstream emissionsâ€™ PDS to be greater than 0, companies would need to request
	// PCFs and their corresponding PDS from their suppliers. Should PDS for relevant components
	// be obtained from upstream suppliers (tier n-1), the total PDS of the PCF should be calculated using
	// a weighted average approach of the material and energy inputs based on their GHG contribution to the
	// studied productâ€™s PCF.
	//
	// To do so, the individual PDSs received from every input supplier (PDSPCFcomponent 1 and
	// PDSPCFcomponent 2) as well as other components, such as energy inputs or direct emissions from
	// production, should be multiplied by their respective relative contribution (in percentage) to the PCF
	// emissions. All weighted PDS components should then be added up to obtain an overarching PDS
	// (PDSPCF product) (Figure 15).
